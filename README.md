# House_Price_Pridiction___Celebal_5


🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict house prices using a real-world dataset. By using Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn, we create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training and real-time prediction based on user input.

📌 Project Objective
The objective is to create a regression model that can:

Accurately predict the market price of a house based on numerical features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

Be interpretable, easy to update, and usable by non-technical users via manual input.

🧠 Key Concepts and Pipeline




1. Loading and Exploring the Dataset
The dataset is imported using pandas.read_csv().

Initial rows are displayed to understand the structure of the dataset.

Summary statistics (df.describe()) and missing value checks (df.isnull().sum()) help understand the quality of data.

📌 Why important?




This ensures data integrity and lets us clean or preprocess columns appropriately before training the model.

2. Data Cleaning and Correlation


Missing rows are removed using df.dropna() to avoid issues during training.

Correlation analysis is performed on numerical columns using df.select_dtypes(include='number').corr() and visualized via seaborn.heatmap.

📌 Why important?




Correlation heatmaps help identify the most influential features on the house price (e.g., area might be positively correlated, while age might be negatively correlated).

3. Feature and Target Selection
The dataset is split into:

X: Feature matrix (independent variables like area, bedrooms, etc.)

y: Target variable (Price or equivalent)

Only numeric features are used to ensure compatibility with Linear Regression.

📌 Why important?




Models can't train on text or categorical values without encoding. Selecting only relevant, clean features increases accuracy and stability.

4. Model Training
The data is split into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

A Linear Regression model is trained using model.fit() from scikit-learn.

📌 Why Linear Regression?





It is one of the simplest and most interpretable models, ideal for understanding relationships in structured data and quickly evaluating performance.

5. Evaluation Metrics
After predictions are made, the following metrics are computed:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

R² Score: Tells how well the independent variables explain the variability in the target variable.

📌 Why important?




These metrics let us quantify how accurate our model is. A high R² and low MSE means good performance.

6. Prediction on User Input
The trained model accepts manual user input for each feature (e.g., enter size = 1000 sqft, 3 bedrooms, etc.).

A DataFrame is created with this input and used for prediction.

The predicted price is printed in a user-friendly format.

📌 Why important?




This makes the project interactive and practical — a potential base for web apps, dashboards, or real estate tools.

7. Visualization
A scatter plot compares actual vs. predicted values to visualize prediction accuracy.

📌 Why important?




You can visually inspect if predictions align well with true prices or if the model consistently over- or under-estimates.

🚀 Future Work & Enhancements




✅ Add date feature extraction (e.g., year built, sold).

✅ Handle categorical features (e.g., location, building type) via One-Hot Encoding.

✅ Switch to more advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM for better accuracy.

✅ Build a Streamlit / Flask app for real-time web predictions.

✅ Add automated hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
